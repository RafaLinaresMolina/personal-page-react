                Hi, my name is <b>Rafa Linares Molina</b> and as you can see I
                am a <s>Wizard</s> <i>Senior FullStack Developer</i>.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am from Valencia, I was born around the 90's (I am almost
                older than the world wide web, may be you hear about it)
              </li>
              <li>
                Since i was very young I can remember tearing apart all the
                electronics my hands could grab to check the internals. But
                after breaking more stuff than ever repaired I decided to start
                my career as full stack developer (you can't over power the code
                and stuff like that...).
              </li>
              <li>
                As in my spare time, I am a person with quite a few interest
                regarding any technological issue, like cybersecurity (as a
                hobby, nothing serious), IoT, and Linux en general.
              </li>
              <li>
                But not all in life is work, I rarely refuse a beer with my
                friends, or boardgames night.
              </li>
